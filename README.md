Bootstrap website

## Useful links

I used bootstrap 5 to build this website along with a tutorial by Brad Traversy on YouTube.

I used this website <a href="getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">get bootstrap</a> as a documentation.

## Recomemndations
I recommend this tutorial by Brad Traversy because he explain everything in details.
